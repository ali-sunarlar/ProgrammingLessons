# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge my-feature branch into main
git merge my-feature

Now, run the following command to create a bare repo in the shared directory:

git init --bare

Set the name of the default branch for the new repo. To accomplish this step, you can change the HEAD branch to point at a different branch; in this case, the main branch:

git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

The output says that the main branch is up to date (in other words, main on Alice's computer matches main in the shared repo). So, Alice merges the add-style branch into the main branch by running git merge --ff-only to perform a fast-forward merge. Then, Alice pushes main from their repo to the shared repo.

git merge --ff-only add-style
git push
